/// The submit method applies a transaction and sends it to
/// the network to be confirmed and included in future ledgers.
///
/// This command has two modes:
/// * Submit-only mode takes a signed, serialized transaction
///   as a binary blob, and submits it to the network as-is.
///   Since signed transaction objects are immutable, no part
///   of the transaction can be modified or automatically
///   filled in after submission.
/// * Sign-and-submit mode takes a JSON-formatted Transaction
///   object, completes and signs the transaction in the same
///   manner as the sign method, and then submits the signed
///   transaction. We recommend only using this mode for
///   testing and development.
///
/// To send a transaction as robustly as possible, you should
/// construct and sign it in advance, persist it somewhere that
/// you can access even after a power outage, then submit it as
/// a tx_blob. After submission, monitor the network with the
/// tx method command to see if the transaction was successfully
/// applied; if a restart or other problem occurs, you can
/// safely re-submit the tx_blob transaction: it won't be
/// applied twice since it has the same sequence number as the
/// old transaction.
///
/// See Submit:
/// `<https://xrpl.org/submit.html>`
