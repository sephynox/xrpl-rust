/// The ripple_path_find method is a simplified version of

/// a payment path you can use right away. It is available in
/// both the WebSocket and JSON-RPC APIs. However, the
/// results tend to become outdated as time passes. Instead of
/// making multiple calls to stay updated, you should instead
/// use the path_find method to subscribe to continued updates
/// where possible.

/// Although the rippled server tries to find the cheapest path
/// or combination of paths for making a payment, it is not
/// guaranteed that the paths returned by this method are, in
/// fact, the best paths.
