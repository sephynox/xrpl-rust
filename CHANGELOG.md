## [[Incomplete]]

- Performance Benchmarks
- Utility functions

## [[Unreleased]]

### Added

- Support for [XLS-0094D DynamicMPT](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/pull/583).
- **XLS-0096 Confidential MPT:** support for the [XLS-0096 ConfidentialTransfer amendment](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0096-confidential-mpt). Adds the vendored `mpt-crypto` native crypto library via the internal `mpt-crypto` (safe Rust wrappers) and `mpt-crypto-sys` (FFI bindings, statically linked) crates.
- **`GenericRequest`:** an untyped, catch-all request type for XRPL RPC commands that don't have a dedicated typed model yet (e.g. `ledger_accept` on standalone rippled, `server_state`). Accepts a `command` string plus a free-form `params: serde_json::Map<String, Value>` bag; `Serialize` flattens `params` alongside `command`/`id` and strips any collision with those reserved keys. Slots into `XRPLRequest::Generic` and the existing `Request` trait so it flows through `client.request(...)` unchanged.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `XRPLSubmitAndWaitException::SubmissionFailed` changed from the tuple variant `SubmissionFailed(String)` to the struct variant `SubmissionFailed { result_code: String, message: Option<String> }`. Callers that pattern-matched on `SubmissionFailed(msg)` must now match `SubmissionFailed { result_code, message }` — the code (`temBAD_SIGNATURE`, `tecUNFUNDED_PAYMENT`, `txnNotFound`, ...) is available without substring-parsing the `Display` string. See [#371](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-rust/issues/371) for the follow-up on typing the code itself.
- Both polling-timeout paths in `wait_for_final_transaction_result` now surface `XRPLSubmitAndWaitException::SubmissionTimeout` (retaining the ledger-sequence context). Previously the retry-cap branch (`c > 20`) returned `SubmissionTimeout` while the after-loop fall-through returned `SubmissionFailed { "submission_timeout" }`; `SubmissionFailed` is now reserved for definite rippled result codes.

### Fixed

- `SubmissionTimeout` `Display` text no longer claims the validated ledger sequence is "greater than" the `LastLedgerSequence` — the retry-cap path can fire while `validated < last`, and the after-loop path also fires on the equality case. Reworded to focus on the outcome (`Transaction not validated before LastLedgerSequence Y (latest validated ledger: X)`) so both paths render correctly.

## [[v1.2.0]]

### Added

- **XLS-33 Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT):** full support for the [XLS-0033 MPTokensV1 amendment](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0033-multi-purpose-tokens).
  - **Binary codec:** `Hash192` type for `MPTokenIssuanceID`; MPT amount encode/decode (UInt64 as base-10 string); `AssetScale` (UInt8) and `MPTAmount`/`MaximumAmount`/`OutstandingAmount` field support.
  - **Amount/Currency:** `MPTAmount` and `MPTCurrency` variants in `Amount`/`Currency` enums; digit-only value validation; `i64::MAX` upper-bound enforcement; `is_mpt()` helper.
  - **Transaction models:** `MPTokenIssuanceCreate`, `MPTokenIssuanceDestroy`, `MPTokenIssuanceSet`, `MPTokenAuthorize`; `Clawback` extended with `MPTAmount` support and optional `Holder` field.
  - **Ledger objects:** `MPToken` and `MPTokenIssuance` with `LockedAmount`, `MPTokenIssuanceMutableFlag` bitmask, and non-null index validation.
  - **Requests:** `AccountObjectType::MptIssuance` and `Mptoken` variants.
  - **Integration tests:** full MPT lifecycle end-to-end (create issuance, holder opt-in, lock/unlock, clawback).
- **XLS-65 Single Asset Vault:** support for the XLS-0065 Single Asset Vault amendment. Adds the `Vault` ledger object; `VaultCreate`, `VaultSet`, `VaultDelete`, `VaultDeposit`, `VaultWithdraw`, and `VaultClawback` transactions; the `vault_info` request and result; `ledger_entry` vault lookup; and the `AccountObjectType::Vault` filter.
- **XLS-47 Price Oracle:** support for the XLS-0047 PriceOracle amendment. Adds the `Oracle` ledger object; `OracleSet` and `OracleDelete` transactions; the `get_aggregate_price` request and result; `ledger_entry` oracle lookup; and the `AccountObjectType::Oracle` filter.
- **XLS-89 MPTokenMetadata:** `utils::mptoken_metadata` helpers to encode, decode, validate, and warn on MPT metadata (`encode_mptoken_metadata`, `decode_mptoken_metadata`, `validate_mptoken_metadata`, `mptoken_metadata_warning`).
- **XLS-39 Clawback:** adds the `Clawback` transaction and the `lsfAllowTrustLineClawback` (`AccountSet`) flag.
- **XLS-70 Credentials:** adds `CredentialCreate`, `CredentialAccept`, and `CredentialDelete` transactions, the `Credential` ledger object, and credential-based `DepositPreauth` fields.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID):** adds the `DIDSet` and `DIDDelete` transactions and the `DID` ledger object.
- New `xrpl::signing` module containing the pure-crypto signing helpers (`sign`, `multisign`, `prepare_transaction`) extracted from `asynch::transaction` and `transaction`. Available with just `core + models + wallet` features (no `helpers`/runtime/client dependency). The legacy paths `asynch::transaction::sign` and `transaction::multisign` are preserved as re-exports for backward compatibility.
- Expanded unit-test coverage and raised CI thresholds: lines `73 → 83`, regions `75 → 85`, functions `67 → 73`.
- Codecov integration with per-PR project (≥83%) and patch (≥80% on new/modified lines) gates.
- Integration-test coverage gate: a CI workflow runs all five integration test binaries under `cargo-llvm-cov`, uploads to codecov under an `integration` flag, and gates the project at ≥65%.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `Amount::is_issued_currency()` now returns `false` for `MPTAmount`. Previously it returned `!is_xrp()`, so any non-XRP amount yielded `true`. With the introduction of the `MPTAmount` variant, callers that used `is_issued_currency()` as a proxy for "not XRP" must be updated to also check `is_mpt()`. Use the new `is_mpt()` helper for MPT-specific branches.
- Unit-test and integration-test coverage are now scoped via Cargo feature flags rather than path regex. The unit-test workflow builds with `--no-default-features --features std,core,utils,wallet,models`, so integration-territory code (CLI, async clients, sync wrappers, faucet) simply isn't compiled and doesn't appear in the unit coverage report.
- Network-dependent inline tests in `src/asynch/transaction/` and `src/asynch/wallet/` (`test_autofill_txn`, `test_autofill_and_sign`, `test_submit_and_wait`, `test_generate_faucet_wallet`) are now gated behind `feature = "integration"` so `cargo test --release` is hermetic by default.
- Codecov **patch** coverage is now gated per flag (separate `unit` and `integration` sections) rather than a single combined gate.

### Fixed

- Non-cryptographic RNG (`Hc128Rng`) was being used for wallet seed generation; replaced with `OsRng` so all key material is sourced from the OS entropy pool (closes #286).
- `RipplePathFind::destination_amount` changed from `Currency<'a>` to `Amount<'a>` to match the XRPL wire format.
- `NoRippleCheckRole` no longer serializes with the `#[serde(tag = "role")]` discriminator; now emits a plain `snake_case` string matching the XRPL wire format.
- `is_success()` now reports success correctly for responses deserialized into typed `XRPLResult` variants (e.g. `ServerInfo`); it consults the preserved raw result JSON instead of the re-serialized typed value.
- `get_latest_open_ledger_sequence` now uses the `ledger_current` request; it previously sent `ledger { ledger_index: "open" }`, which rippled rejects with `invalidParams`.

## [[v1.1.0]]

- `DepositPreauth` ledger object: `authorize` field changed from `Cow<'a, str>` to `Option<Cow<'a, str>>` to support XLS-70 credential-based preauthorization. The `new()` constructor is unchanged (still accepts non-optional `authorize`), but direct struct construction must wrap the value in `Some(...)`.
- `credential_ids` field on `AccountDelete`, `Payment`, `EscrowFinish`, `PaymentChannelClaim`, and `credentials` on `DepositAuthorized` request changed from `Option<Cow<'a, [Cow<'a, str>]>>` to `Option<Vec<Cow<'a, str>>>` for reliable serde round-trip.

### Added

- Implemented full deserialization from hex binary back to JSON, update `definitions.json` to `xrpl.js` latest, added all codec test fixtures from xrpl.js and implemented tests for all of them.
- Added integration tests for all transaction types, refactored to separate files.
- Added initial XLS-70 Credentials model support (`CredentialCreate`, `CredentialAccept`, `CredentialDelete`, `Credential` ledger object, and credential-based `DepositPreauth` fields).

- Fixed serialization issues for `PathSet`, `Issue`, and `STArray` types.
